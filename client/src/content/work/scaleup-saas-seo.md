## The Challenge

ScaleFlow had a superior product but zero visibility. They were burning cash on LinkedIn ads with a CAC that was unsustainable. They needed a channel that compounded over time.

## The Solution

We ignored the high-volume keywords and went for the "long-tail intent." We built:

*   **Semantic Topic Clusters:** 50+ interlinked articles covering every pain point of their ICP.
*   **Programmatic SEO Pages:** Generated 500+ landing pages for specific use cases.
*   **High-Authority Backlinks:** secured placements in top industry publications.

## The Results

The organic engine kicked in after month 3, and the growth curve went parabolic:

*   **From 0 to $1M ARR** in 14 months entirely inbound
*   **+300% increase** in organic traffic YoY
*   **CAC reduced by 70%** compared to paid channels
