## The Challenge

LuxeRetail's loyalty program was dormant. Points were expiring unused. They needed to re-engage Gen Z consumers who value digital ownership over plastic cards.

## The Solution

We tokenized their top-tier membership into a "Golden Ticket" NFT. It wasn't just a receipt; it was a pass.

*   **Exclusive Access:** Holders got early access to limited drops.
*   **Tradability:** Users could sell their membership if they no longer wanted it, creating a secondary market.
*   **Phygital Merch:** NFC-chipped hoodies connected to the NFT.

## The Results

The campaign went viral on TikTok and revitalized the brand:

*   **40,000+** new wallets created by non-crypto natives
*   **$2M+** in secondary usage volume
*   **Youngest demographic** influx in company history
