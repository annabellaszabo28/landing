## The Challenge

Launching a DEX in 2025 is hard. Liquidity is sticky. Nova Fi needed to attract millions in capital from day one to ensure trade execution and low slippage.

## The Solution

We designed a "Vampire Attack" campaign targeting incumbent protocols, but with a twist—we rewarded long term alignment.

*   **Points Program:** Gamified liquidity provision with multiplier for duration.
*   **KOL Campaign:** Onboarded 50 key voices in DeFi to educate, not just shill.
*   **Cross Chain Bridge:** Seamless onboarding from L2s.

## The Results

Liquidity flooded in, but more importantly, it stayed:

*   **$50M TVL** achieved in the first week
*   **15,000+** active daily users
*   **Sustainability:** 80% retention rate after rewards halving
