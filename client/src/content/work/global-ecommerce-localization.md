## The Challenge

MarketOne wanted to expand globally, but traditional translation agencies were too slow and expensive. They missed trend cycles in local markets.

## The Solution

We deployed an agentic workflow for real time localization.

*   **Cultural Adaptation:** AI didn't just translate text; it swapped images and idioms to match local culture.
*   **Dynamic Pricing:** Agents adjusted pricing based on local purchasing power parity.
*   **Instant SEO:** Generated thousands of localized landing pages overnight.

## The Results

Expansion velocity increased by 10x:

*   **Launched in 25 countries** in Q3 alone
*   **40% revenue** now coming from international markets
*   **Zero** increase in headcount for the localization team
