Liquidity is mercenary; community is missionary. In the long run, only the missionaries survive. But how do you build a moat around your tribe?

## 1. The Identity Moat

When holding your token becomes part of someone's digital identity (think PFPs or ENS names), selling becomes an identity crisis. This is the strongest form of retention.

## 2. The Governance Moat

*   **Real Power:** Give the community actual decisions to make, not just theatre.
*   **Skin in the Game:** Require staking for voting to align incentives.

## 3. The Education Moat

A community that learns together, earns together. By becoming the primary source of truth for your niche, you create a dependency that transcends price action.
