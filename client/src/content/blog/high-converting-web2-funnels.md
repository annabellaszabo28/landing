The era of "build it and they will airdrop" is dead. As the Web3 market matures, the winning protocols are those that master the art of the **Capitalist Funnel**.

## The Hybrid Model

We are seeing a convergence where decentralized infrastructure meets Web2 user acquisition tactics. Use Facebook Ads to drive traffic, but use on chain data to qualify leads. This is the hybrid model that lowers CAC while increasing LTV.

## Frictionless Onboarding

Your funnel shouldn't start with "Connect Wallet." It should start with value. Educational content, interactive demos, and email capture forms are the new "Hello World" of crypto marketing. Seed phrases come later.
