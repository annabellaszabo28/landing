Most token economists ignore Google. Most SEOs ignore smart contracts. The alpha lies in the intersection.

## The Traffic to Token Pipeline

Organic traffic is free. Token emissions are expensive. By replacing paid ads with high intent SEO traffic, you reduce the sell pressure on your treasury. It's simple math that most projects miss.

## Keyword dominance as Authority

Ranking #1 for "decentralized lending" isn't just about traffic; it's about perceived market leadership. This perception drives token demand, which funds further development, which improves the product (and rankings).

## The Flywheel Effect

When your documentation and whitepaper profit from SEO, you attract developers. Developers build utility. Utility drives value. Value drives searches. The cycle repeats.
